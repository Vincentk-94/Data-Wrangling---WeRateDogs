# Data-Wrangling - WeRateDogs Twitter Archive

In this project I will be gathering data from the WeRateDogs Twitter account. An archive of over 5,000 tweets up to August 1, 2017 has been downloaded to be analysed. Additionally, a file containing the top 3 image predictions for the dog breeds of these tweets using a neural network has been provided. Additional tweet information such as retweet and favourite count will be collected for each tweet in the archive. This will be obtained by querying Twitter's API for each tweet's JSON data using the Tweepy library. This will then be stored into a .txt file and finally read into a Pandas DataFrame. 

I will be using Python with the following libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Tweepy, JSON and Seaborn.

This project will require me to gather the relevant data from Twitter; clean the data by fixing quality and tidiness issues; perform analysis of the clean data then produce a report outlining the wrangling process as well as a report containing insights and visualisations based on findings.
